Its year 2018 and I still haven't reflected upon all the things I achieved last year, or things I want to do this year. So I will do it now. After digging through all my profiles (stackoverflow, github, bookmarks, projects, photos on phone, workout log, and journal log), this is a comprised list of things I achieved, and what things I want to finish in the future

## My last years achievements that I did on my free time :) 2017

*   Learn React and NodeJS and build a test app from it. Other libraries as needed
*   Write more expressive code using airbnb javascript styleguides
*   Haven't really put too much thought on personal projects, I did want to use dynalist API to make a table-of-contents scroller though. From there who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
*   **Other Maybes, possibly not-goals** (Learn Vagrant + linux + php + lamp stack, make some money on cryptocurrency exchanges, learning PHP in greater detail / laravel, picking up haskell / learning more python, making some python projects on the side, Possibly make youtube tech tutorials.
*   Learn the ukelele (I have one coming next week~!)

#### Habits, Social, & Fitness 2018

*   Do an unassisted handstand _may not happen this year_
*   Buy an olympic bar and a power-rack, I need a bigger home gym
*   Habit: Post a blog about something at least once every 2 weeks, probably Saturday morning

I have this set on [tabsnooze](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-snooze/pdiebiamhaleloakpcgmpnenggpjbcbm?hl=en) to see if I accomplish any of this next year. Also I put my workout routines on hold since I pulled a neck muscle, had bad form and lifted too much in cold weather.

I tried to be as realistic as possible for things I want to accomplish in 2018. Things that are within my ability to finish. I tend to set the bar low so hopefully I get a pleasant surprise at the end of the year
