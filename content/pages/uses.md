Inspiration for writing this page comes from [uses.tech](https://uses.tech). Here's all the tools I use, and the reason I use them (updated as of April 2020).

A little bit about myself:

- Software developer who loves learning and exploring other hobbies
- Low-tech options first if it works, stickynotes are my jam
- Less tooling is always better
- Work at an agency, so I write in a few frameworks / languages: C# / Angular / Vue / React/ NodeJS.
- MacOS and Windows for development (C# works better in Windows)

TODO - add picture of the space here

# General Tools

## MacOS Hardware

- **2015 MacBookPro**: I bought it slightly used, I really love the butterfly scissor keyboard and legacy USB ports
- **27" Monitor**: Any will do. I prefer one big monitor instead of two smaller 24". Easier to manage
- **GeChic HDMI Portable External Monitor**: If I work out of a coffee shop, I always use a 2nd monitor
- **eBags Backpack**: Best techie backpack imo
- **MagicTrackPad2 + keyboard**: When I mount my macOS in desktop mode, I prefer to type on a seperate keyboard. Better ergonomics

## MacOS General Tools

- **Gifox**: Recording gifs on my macOS. Usually I want to send progress reports to work
- **Greenshot**: My choice of screenshot editing software, looking for something better
- **Magnet**: Moving screens around between two monitors, etc. I never dock my windows in full-screen mode. Favorite keybinds: CMD+OPTIONS+ENTER to maximize window, CMD+â†’ to move my screen to right monitor (vice versa)

## Windows Hardware

- **24" Vertical Monitor** - Dell U2415 and move it into vertical mode
- **HDMI Switcher** - I share my 27" monitor b/w my macOS and windows computer. I just press a button and swap HDMI inputs
- **80% mechanical keyboard** - Doesn't have the numpad. I just buy the cheapest Chinese knockoff on Amazon with cherry brown-like switches
- **Logitech Compact Speakers** - Don't have space or need good speakers

## Windows General Tools

- **ShareX** - Gif recording
- **Greenshot** - Screenshot edit recording

## Online Based Tools

- **GoogleSuite** - GoogleDrive, GoogleDocs, GoogleSlides, etc. My defacto pick for working in projects, b/c everyone knows how to use it
- **Dropbox** - Backing up important stuff
- **BackBlaze** - Backing up dropbox and other systems *(always have 3 backups in 3 different areas!)*
- **VLC Player**: Video player
- **Flux**: Reduce blue light at night so I can sleep easier
- **Slack**: Team communication
- **Zoom**: Remote meetings
- **Figma**: Mockups, sometimes I'll use Sketch for macOs
- **Draw.io**: Database Diagrams
- **Excalidraw**: Hand drawn diagrams
- **Simplenote**: Daily driver, mostly as cross platform tool for taking unflavored notes quickly. Less features is more imo

## Chrome Extensions

I find myself using these less and less. Partially b/c they're just giant security vulnerabilities

- **LastPass** - password manager
- **uBlock Origin** - Ad Blocker
- **Video Controller** - Controlling playback on web videos. I bound `[` and `]` for speed down, speed up respectively
- **Google Dictionary** - Highlight the word to find it's definition
- **Imagus** - Hover over image to see the full preview
- **OctoTree** - Github folder navigator
- **TabSnooze** - Remind myself later to look at something, using this less frequently now
- **FullPageScreenshot** - Useful for screenshotting entire page, project status updates to work

# Coding Tools

## MacOS Software Tools

- **Dbeaver**: Database tool. I use it for seeding data and visualizing database diagrams
- **Postman**: RESTful endpoint test suite
- **Insomnia**: GraphQL endpoint test suite
- **SequelPro**: Best for importing .SQL files locally
- **Iterm/oh-my-zsh**: Favorite terminal. Love having 10 different folders open here, it's my main means of swapping b/w projects. I type `code .` at the file directory to open it in visual-studio-code. I bound CTRL+OPTION+SPACEBAR to toggle visibility for all my terminals

## Windows Software Tools

- **Visual Studio** - for C# development
- **SSMS / SQL Server** - .NET development

## Visual Studio Code Plugins

Visual studio code is my favorite IDE. Here's all my favorite plugins. There's specific Angular/React/Vue tools I occasionally use, these are `Vue VS Code Extension Pack`, Angular I use John Papa's `Angular Essentials`. React 

- **GitLens**: Scroll through commit message across each line is immensely helpful. It gives me superpower insights on who wrote the code and why, sometimes leading to a bigger story. Or when I need to go back in time to see what I worked on
- **Bracket Pair Colorizer**: Let's me identify different {} closing brackets relative to where they are at. Super helpful when looking at alot of nested code
- **Import Cost**: Let's me see if my import statements were done correctly, by showing the package size in node_modules. 
- **Prettier**: Autoformatting tool. I run this manually everytime (highlight code -> format selection). Really useful when I encounter hard to read code

## Javascript Libraries

- **Bootstrap/Reactstrap** - Quickly making frontend applications
- **Typescript** - Prefer writing javascript with types
- **Tailwinds** - I make my own version of it for global utility styles
- **Sass** - Precompiled CSS, for writing clean nested styles
- **React** - My preference on frontend framework
- **Gatsby** - JAMstack app powering this site! :)
- [https://github.com/vincentntang?tab=stars](https://github.com/vincentntang?tab=stars) - Everything else here

## Service Providers

- **Netlify** - Hosting Provider for frontend apps
- **Azure** - Prefer this over AWS, less confusing to use
- **Ngrok** - Port Forwarding, incase I need to bypass firewalls
- **Heroku** - Good for backend+frontend hackathon apps (its free!)

# Recording Tools

## Sound/Video Hardware

I occasionally speak at tech conferences, and I'm currently starting a podcast with my dev buddy. Storytelling in videography/filming has always been a passion of mine, currently this is what I use:

- **GoPro8**: Timelapse shots, action cam, and quick selfy-vlogging. I love just picking this up, hitting record, and dumping the contents so I can edit later in AdobePremierePro.
- **Tascam DR-10L**: So many times where I wish I had a high-def backup sound recording. Podcasts, tech conferences, etc. Sound is more important than video,
- **Sony A6400**: Still learning, but I like the ability to potentially color-grade my video shots, and add native bokeh

- **Pixel 3**: My phone, it takes nice photos thanks to google software
- **ManFrottoGO**: Smallest Tripod on the market, compacts to 12". Great for Travel
- **External Anker Batteries**: Can never have enough of these. I add velcro tape to it and stick it to my tripod
- **BlueYeti**: My favorite standalone mic, mounted on a pole arm
- **SamsungGoMic**: Attach this to my laptop for cardinal directly recording, super portable
- **Vogek Headphones**: Cheap $12 headphones on amazon, lightweight portable and sound great. What's not to love here!?

## Sound/Video Software

- **Audacity**: Sound Editing Tooling
- **AdobeCC**: Video Editing Tooling
- **OBS Studio**: Screen Recording
- **Loom** - Quick webinar recordings

# Exploration

## Tools I'm exploring

- Native MacOS Emoji Library - I always find myself googling emojis
- Timesnapper for MacOS - recording events I do daily, mostly for reproducing sysadmin type work
- Clipboard manager for MacOS - The best redundancy for saving docs is just highlightAll -> copy. Ditto works great for windows, not sure if there's something for MacOS
